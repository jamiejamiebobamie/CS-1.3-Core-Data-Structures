SCENARIO #2

There is no order to the routes in the route file, so the entirety of the file
has to be read. Because each route has a cost associated with it, it makes sense
to create a dictionary of routes to costs, key-value pairs.

Iterate over the route-costs in the routeFile and create a a dictionary of routes to costs, key-value pairs.
Iterate over the phoneNumbers file and split each line into an array.

Feed that array of phoneNumbers into a function that concatenates a test string composed of digits of a phoneNumber
and tests if that test-string is a key in the dictionary. If it is, return the cost associated with that number.

Return an array of tuples that consist of phoneNumbers and their associated costs.

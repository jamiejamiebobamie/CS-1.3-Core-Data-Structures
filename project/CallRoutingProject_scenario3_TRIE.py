'''An autocomplete function. Call the function in the terminal and

Input:  python3 autocompleteWithClasses.py lla
Output: ['llama', 'llanberisslate', 'llandeilo', 'llandovery', 'llano', 'llautu']

TO-DO: Rewrite code in Javascript and then make a website
       that hosts the already built Trie in a database and pulls from it
       dynamically, displaying the possibile words in a drop-down menu as the user types.

       Find out how much 'overhead', it costs to have these extra properties in the TrieNode.
